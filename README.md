**Project Overview:**

The **3D Space Shooter Game** is a real-time, arcade-style shooting game built using **C++**, **OpenGL**, **FreeGLUT**, and **GLEW**. Inspired by the classic **arcade space shooter games** from the golden age of video gaming, this project brings that nostalgic gameplay into a modern 3D environment. Players control a spaceship navigating through space, avoiding and destroying enemy ships while maintaining health and earning points.

The game combines fundamental computer graphics principles with gameplay logic to simulate an engaging space battle. The design follows a modular, object-oriented approach, with each gameplay component—player, enemies, bullets, and game logic—encapsulated in separate classes for clarity and scalability.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Smooth Movement & Controls**: Responsive player controls and fluid navigation through 3D space.
- **Enemy Movement**: Enemies approach the player, and shoot in controlled bursts.
- **Health System**: Player has an energy score that changes colour based on health of the player.
- **Real-time Gameplay**: Fast-paced action with collision detection, shooting logic, and scoring.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Moving star background to simulate motion through space and enhance immersion.
- **Aiming System**: Player is enabled to target the enemies in order to shoot bullets.

**Scope of the Project:**

The scope of the **3D Space Shooter Game** project includes the design, development, and demonstration of a simple but functional 3D arcade-style space shooting game. The game is developed using **C++ with OpenGL**, along with **FreeGLUT** and **GLEW** libraries to handle rendering and input.

This project aims to simulate key elements of a classic space shooter while introducing fundamental concepts of 3D game development and computer graphics. The scope includes:

**In-Scope Features:**

- **3D Player Ship Movement**: The player can move their spaceship in multiple directions within the game window
- **Shooting Mechanism**: The player can shoot bullets at enemy cubes.
- **Enemy Behaviour**: Enemies spawn, move toward the player and shoot bullets in bursts at the player.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects collisions between bullets and the player or the enemy cubes, triggering damage.
- **Health System**:
  - The Player has a health score that tracks the energy of the Player Cone.
  - Health score changes colour based on remaining health (i.e., green to red).
- **Score System**: Tracks the number of enemies destroyed (100 points per enemy).
- **Game State Management**: Handles game running and defeat states.
- **3D Rendering**: Objects are rendered in a 3D environment with visual cues like stars for background motion.
- **Modular Codebase**: Clean separation of game logic and object behaviour using OOP principles.

**Out-of-Scope (Currently):**

- Advanced environment (e.g., asteroids, debris, etc)
- Infinite Game Loop and no actual ‘Victory’ stage.
- Complex enemy types or power-ups.
- Advanced 3D models (currently uses simple shapes for ships and bullets).
- Audio (music and sound effects).
- Saving/loading game progress or levels.
